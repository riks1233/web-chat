# Rich Web Chat
Simple chatroom with stylish registration form (turn on sound for best experience!).
- **Realization:** Node.js (express + socket.io) + pure html, css and javascript
- **Scope:** Web-dev skills development, first "big" web app for me. Aim for the registration page was to make its usage feel as nice as possible (UX).
- **NOTE:** Prone to html injections.
- **Running the app:** (Node.js needs to be installed and reachable). Run "node server" in project directory to run the server on port 3000. To test, go to localhost:3000 in Your browser.

Check out [live version](https://rich-web-chat.herokuapp.com)! (P.S. No chatbot included. For testing purposes You would have to open 2 browser tabs. Both tabs will produce sound which is a bit annoying, sorry for that!).
