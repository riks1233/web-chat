# Rich Web Chat (January 2020)

Simple chatroom with stylish registration form (turn on sound for best experience!).
- **Realization:** Node.js (express + socket.io) + pure html, css and javascript
- **Scope:** Web-dev skills development, first "big" web app for me. Aim for the registration page was to make its usage feel as nice as possible (UX).
- **NOTE:** Prone to html injections.
- **Running the app:** (Node.js needs to be installed and reachable). Run "node server" in project directory to run the server on port 3000. To test, go to localhost:3000 in Your browser. You will need to open the app in two browser tabs to simulate separate chatroom users.

# Update (December 2022)

- Updated dependencies due to vulnerabilities.
  - Quick-fixed code-breaking changes. Some visuals are lacking.
- Working Heroku web link removed (not free anymore).
